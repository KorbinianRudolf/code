# PythonCode
My own repository for code examples in Python

What it contains right now: Examples for
- a Filter, so picture manipulation
- a user IO with use of json as database
- an example with just user IO
- and I forgot what showFile was supposed to do
- magic is a script i wrote to get the idea how a magic tric by the Ehrlich Brothers worked. So don't read it if you want to keep the illusion alive, i guess.
- fizzBuzz is google-able
- 2 different experiments with neural networks
- pictureCode is the test of an idea to hide words in the rgb values of pixels
